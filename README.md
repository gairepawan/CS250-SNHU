1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   User needs are effectively translated into actionable tasks through user stories, which guide developers in accurately defining and implementing features using code.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   In developing programs, I prefer using Agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban. These methods break work into manageable tasks, ensuring regular feedback and quick adjustments. Scrum organizes tasks into short sprints with clear goals, supported by meetings for planning and review. Kanban visualizes workflow and limits work in progress for efficiency. Both approaches help teams stay flexible, adapt to changes, and deliver software that meets user needs effectively. Integrating Agile processes ensures our development is responsive, productive, and continually improving.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   I think being a good team member in software is like being on any team. It means being willing to try new things, being honest, and staying open. In software, there are many tasks, some not so glamorous or fully understood at first, but they still need to get done. When I'm unsure about how to do something because it's new or unfamiliar, I make sure to ask my team for help. They might know a standard way to do it or have a tool that can help us out.
